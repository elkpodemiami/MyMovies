MyMovies is a web application written on ReactJS that allows you to create, edit, delete, and search for movies with the power of ReactJS

## Description

This project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Deployment

To deploy the MyMovies project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Once the installation is complete, start the development server with `npm start`.
